# OpenAI Speech Assistant

**Project Description**: This project is a speech-enabled assistant that uses **OpenAI's GPT API** for intelligent responses, with **Speech Recognition** for voice input. The assistant listens to user speech, converts it to text, sends it to OpenAI's API, and speaks back the generated response.
